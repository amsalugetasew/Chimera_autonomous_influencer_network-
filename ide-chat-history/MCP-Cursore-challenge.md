when I tried to connect MCP server but couldn't connect for authentication to load the available tools 

here is my chat history

available MCP Server?

Checking MCP configuration in the workspace for available MCP servers.
Here are the MCP servers that appear to be available:
Configured MCP servers
tenxfeedbackanalytics (tenxanalysismcp)
Configured in .cursor/mcp.json
URL: https://mcppulse.10academy.org/proxy
Headers: X-Device: windows, X-Coding-Tool: cursor
cursor-ide-browser
Used for web navigation and page interaction (MCP instructions mention it)
Supports navigating URLs, taking snapshots, clicking, typing, form filling, screenshots, and similar browser automation
Note: tenxfeedbackanalytics is in the workspace config. cursor-ide-browser may be set up in your global/user Cursor settings. To see the full list, check:
Workspace: .cursor/mcp.json
User/global: Cursor Settings → MCP

interact with my logs

Checking MCP resources for log-related tools:
Here’s what I found about logs in your setup and what I can do with them:
Logs in your workspace
.claude/debug/ – Debug logs from the IDE (e.g. f582eb1c-782b-4812-933d-382a867fcb06.txt) with startup and runtime events.
.claude/cache/changelog.md – Claude Code changelog (release notes), not runtime logs.
What I can do with your logs
I can help you interact with the debug logs in these ways:
Read and display – Show specific files or ranges.
Search / filter – Look for errors, warnings, or patterns (e.g. MCP, startup, network).
Summarize – Give a short overview of what’s happening (startup, failures, config).
Parse and explain – Break down timestamps, events, and errors.
Example lines from your current debug log:
2026-02-06T00:08:56.677Z [DEBUG] [init] configureGlobalMTLS starting2026-02-06T00:08:56.740Z [DEBUG] [STARTUP] Loading MCP configs...2026-02-06T00:08:56.804Z [DEBUG] [STARTUP] Running setup()...2026-02-06T00:08:56.809Z [DEBUG] Loading skills from: managed=..., user=...
About the tenxfeedbackanalytics MCP: Your rules mention log_passage_time_trigger and log_performance_outlier_trigger. Those tools would talk to the 10 Academy feedback/analytics system. I don’t currently have those MCP tools available, so I can only work with the local files above.
Tell me what you want to do with the logs (e.g. “search for errors”, “summarize startup”, “find MCP entries”), and I’ll do it.

call available tools

Here’s what ran and what’s available:
Tools invoked
Tool	Result
list_mcp_resources	No MCP resources found
LS (list_dir)	Listed project root; found .claude, .cursor, architecture, specs, ide-chat-history, etc.
browser_tabs (cursor-ide-browser)	No open browser tabs (or empty tab list)
MCP-related tools available
MCP resources:
list_mcp_resources – lists resources from MCP servers
fetch_mcp_resource – fetches a specific resource by URI
cursor-ide-browser: navigation and interaction tools such as:
browser_navigate, browser_snapshot, browser_click, browser_type, browser_fill
browser_tabs, browser_scroll, browser_take_screenshot, browser_wait_for
browser_lock / browser_unlock, and related actions
Note: The tenxfeedbackanalytics MCP (mcppulse.10academy.org) doesn’t expose any resources here. Tools like log_passage_time_trigger and log_performance_outlier_trigger would need to come from that server, but they don’t appear in the current tool set.

call log passage time trigger

I can't call log_passage_time_trigger because it isn’t in my tool set.
That tool is supposed to come from the tenxfeedbackanalytics MCP (mcppulse.10academy.org). From what I can use, that server exposes no tools or resources—list_mcp_resources returns nothing, and there is no log_passage_time_trigger available to invoke.
How to fix it
Confirm MCP configuration
Check that tenxfeedbackanalytics is correctly set in:
.cursor/mcp.json
Cursor Settings → MCP
Restart Cursor
Restart the editor after changing MCP settings so tools can load.
Verify the server
Ensure https://mcppulse.10academy.org/proxy is reachable and the MCP server is running and exposing tools.
Ask 10 Academy
If you’re in a program that uses this MCP, ask them how to enable log_passage_time_trigger and log_performance_outlier_trigger in Cursor.
Once that MCP exposes the tool, I’ll be able to call it.
